# crop and weed detection using object detection algorithms namely yolov5 and ssdmobilenet and compared the results of both
Agriculture is the primary source of income for the majority of Indians. In recent years, weeds are responsible for agricultural losses. To get rid of this problem, the farmers have to uniformly spray the whole field with weedicides which require a huge quantity of weedicides. The process of spraying weedicides affects the environment. To control and prevent weeds, a weed detection method should be implemented. This paper proposes an effective weed detection method using deep learning models that detect weeds in sesame crops. In this work, two single-stage object detection algorithms namely YOLOV5 and SSD Mobilenet V2 are used to detect the weeds. Both models are analyzed based on their performance. The parameters used to determine the accuracy in detection are MAP, Precision, and recall
